# AcesOfTheArcade
This is a small Shoot em up game using Kenny Assets Pixel Shmup Asset pack for all the art assets.
I also used old Call of Duty sound effects of germans yelling for the enemy planes.

This game was made in 2024 mostly just for fun and because of my nostalgia for old shmup games like Aces of The Luftwaffe.

The game can be found on my itch page by using the following link.
